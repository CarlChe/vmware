VMware Virtual Networking Concepts
  
Introduction

  With virtual networking, you can network virtual machines in the same way that you do physical machines and can build
  complex networks within a single ESX Server hosts or across multiple ESX Server hosts.
  
  Virtual switches allow virtual machines on the same ESX Server host to communicate with eache other using the same 
  protocols that would be used over physical switches, without the need for additional networking hardware. ESX Server 
  virtual switches also support VLANs that are compatible with standard VLAN implementations from other vendors.
  
VMware Infrastructure Networking Components
  The key virtual network components provided by Virutal Infrastructure 3 are virtual Ethernet adapters, used by individual 
  virtual machines, and virtual switches, which connect virtual machines to each other and connect both virtual machines and the ESX
  Server service console to external networks.
  
How Virtual Ethernet Adapters Work
  Three types of virtual adapter (for VMs):
    vmxnet
      
    vlance
    
    e1000
    
  Other virtual network adapters:
    vswif -- a paravirtualized device similar to vmxnet that is only used by ESX Server service console
    vmknic -- a virtual device in the VMkernel, the software layer that manages most of the physical resources on the ESX Server host.
    
How Virtual Switches Work
   
   Virtual switches are the key networking components in VMware Infrastructure 3. "built ot order" at runtime from a collection
   of small functional units, Some of the key functional units are:
    
    *The core Layer 2 forwarding engine
    *VLAN tagging, stripping, and filtering units.
    *Layer 2 security, checksum, and segmentation offload units.
