VMware Virtual Networking Concepts
  
Introduction

  With virtual networking, you can network virtual machines in the same way that you do physical machines and can build
  complex networks within a single ESX Server hosts or across multiple ESX Server hosts.
  
  Virtual switches allow virtual machines on the same ESX Server host to communicate with eache other using the same 
  protocols that would be used over physical switches, without the need for additional networking hardware. ESX Server 
  virtual switches also support VLANs that are compatible with standard VLAN implementations from other vendors.
  
VMware Infrastructure Networking Components
  The key virtual network components provided by Virutal Infrastructure 3 are virtual Ethernet adapters, used by individual 
  virtual machines, and virtual switches.
